Step 1: Identify all the data points in the stem and leaf plot.
From the stem and leaf plot, the points per game are as follows:
- 21
- 24
- 34, 35
- 49
- 56, 57, 58
- 66, 66
- 75, 76
- 84, 85, 85, 85
- 90

Step 2: Arrange the data points in ascending, descending or random order.
The points in ascending order are:
21, 24, 34, 35, 49, 56, 57, 58, 66, 66, 75, 76, 84, 85, 85, 85, 90

Step 3: Find the median.
Since there are 17 data points (an odd number), the median is the middle number when ordered.
In this case, the 9th number in the ordered list is the median.
The 9th number is 56.

Therefore, the median number of points scored per game is 56.
