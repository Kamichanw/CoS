To find the median, I need to follow these steps:
1. List all the values in ascending order.
2. Identify the middle value(s).

Let's list the values:
20, 24, 20, 30, 34, 35, 40, 49, 50, 56, 57, 58, 60, 60, 66, 66, 70, 75, 76, 80, 85, 85, 85, 86, 90

There are 25 values, so the median will be the 13th value in this ordered list.
The 13th value is 60.

Therefore, the median number of points scored per game is 60.
