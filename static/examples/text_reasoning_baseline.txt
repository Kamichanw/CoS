Rearrange equation: divide by x^2 and let's use partial fractions to simplify the equation.
To simplify, write each fraction as a difference: $1 + \frac{x-4}{(x+2)(x+2)(x-5)} = 1 + \frac{(x-2) - (x-5)}{x^2-10x}$.
3. 2x^2 - 4x - 16 = 0.
4. Add 16 to both sides: 2x^2 - 4x = 0
5. Divide by 2: x^2 - 2x = 0.
6. Take out x: x(x-2) = 0. Elie: x = 0 or x = 2.
Therefore, the sum of all real solutions to the equation is x = 0 + 2 = $\boxed{2}$.
