First, I'll identify each vehicle in the image. There is a double bus (blue), a car (tan), a car (yellow), a motorcycle (green), a scooter (cyan), and an airplane (gray). Some of these are likely to have wheels. 

Now, examining the vehicles one by one:
- The blue double bus typically has wheels.
- The tan car and the yellow car have wheels.
- The green motorcycle has two wheels.
- The scooter likely has two wheels as well.
- The gray airplane typically has small wheels beneath.

When considering this categorically, all of these vehicles seem to have wheels. However, classifying vehicles as always having wheels or as having potential wheels introduces subjectivity. Typically most vehicles have wheels unless otherwise specified, so I'll make conservative assumptions regarding certainty.

I'll perform a count suggesting the vehicles have wheels:
1. The double bus has wheels.
2. The cars each usually have wheels.
3. The motorcycle presumably has wheels.
4. The scooter likely has typical two wheels.
5. The airplane typically has wheels.

Thus, I will count the potentially wheel-related vehicles (assumed to have wheels before explicit confirmation):
1. (Wheel-like others might exist)

Final number of vehicles likely to have wheels:
\boxed{4}
